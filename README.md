# INFO6123 Web Design Course Project

## Mihir Prakashbhai Jain

I have created the website for my services.
It features a dark color contrast and gradient effect animations on some of the div containers.
For fonts, I have used Google Fonts (Dhurjati and Playfair Display).
In terms of accessibility, I have applied some of the ARIA principles, such as using the <strong> tag, and I have provided headings and alternative text for the images.
Regarding SEO, I am incorporating long-tail keywords in my web pages as well as in the meta tags and description.

Basically I have designed the website with whatever I have learned throughout the course.
